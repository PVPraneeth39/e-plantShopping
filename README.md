Paradise Nursery – E-Plant Shopping App

Paradise Nursery is a React and Redux powered e-commerce web application built using Vite, where users can browse plant categories, add products to a shopping cart, update quantities, remove items, and view the total cart amount and total quantity dynamically. The application uses Redux Toolkit to manage the cart state efficiently through a dedicated CartSlice that handles actions such as addItem, removeItem, and updateQuantity. The Redux store is configured using configureStore and connected to the application via the React Redux Provider. Cart calculations such as total cost and total quantity are computed using JavaScript’s reduce() method to ensure real-time updates when items are modified. The “Continue Shopping” functionality toggles between the product listing and cart view using controlled state in the ProductList component. The project is deployed using GitHub Pages, with proper Vite base configuration and build deployment using the gh-pages package. This application demonstrates state management, component communication, Redux integration, and production deployment in a modern React environment.
